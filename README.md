Part 1:
The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a unit in the hospital where seriously ill patients are cared for by specially trained staff. The ICU staff includes doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, clinical nurse specialists, pharmacists, physical therapists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dietitians, social workers, and chaplains. Due to the fact that there must always be room for seriously ill patients, we need to consider how long a patient will be in the ICU to both prepare for the arrival of new patients as well as providing the patient with a reasonable time frame for how long they will be in the ICU. 


Part 2: 
Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that is one of the most common problems that arises after hospitalizations. This condition arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Sepsis can be classified into different types depending upon the severity of the disease. Thus, risk of death from sepsis is as high as 30%, from severe sepsis as high as 50%, and from septic shock as high as 80%. In this project, we will be concentrating on predicting  if  a  patient  will  develop  Sepsis  in  general.  Identifying  Sepsis  early  on  using  machine learning models can greatly improve the quality of life for patients and potentially save millions of lives.
