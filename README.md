# Project-2-Length-Of-Stay
Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that is one of the most common problems that arises after hospitalizations. This condition arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Sepsis can be classified into different types depending upon the severity of the disease. Thus, risk of death from sepsis is as high as 30%, from severe sepsis as high as 50%, and from septic shock as high as 80%. In this project, we will be concentrating on predicting  if  a  patient  will  develop  Sepsis  in  general.  Identifying  Sepsis  early  on  using  machine learning models can greatly improve the quality of life for patients and potentially save millions of lives.
